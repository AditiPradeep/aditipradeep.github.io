Big data is the backbone of modern particle physics. Did you know that [CERN](https://home.cern/science/computing/storage) produces millions of gigabytes of data in an average experimental run? While CERN smashes highly energetic particle beams to produce a large number of collision events (and thus a large amount of data), dark matter searches are typically what are called "rare event searches" in the particle physics community. Rare event searches, as the name suggests, seek to find extremely rare physical phenomena in the universe, such as a dark matter particle scattering off a crystal in a deep underground laboratory. By definition, you would naturally expect less data from a rare event search experiment compared to a collider experiment such as the [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider). Yet, my experiment, [SuperCDMS](https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/) e.g., is expected to produce ~100 TB of data in a year. To provide a sense of how massive this is, the training data for [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) was 570 GB post filtering of the acquired 45 TB of data from 2016-2019.

Big data calls for extensive and creative data analysis techniques, making every particle physicist also a data scientist.

I am a scientist, specifically a particle astrophysicist, searching for the elusive dark mattter at the University of British Columbia. I use the power of machine learning combined with statistics to extract the faintest hint of a dark matter signal from large, noisy data sets.
