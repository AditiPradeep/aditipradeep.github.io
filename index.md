I am a scientist, specifically a particle astrophysicist, searching for the elusive dark mattter at the University of British Columbia. I work on SuperCDMS which uses cryogenic detectors equipped with superconducting circuitry to detect dark matter interactions. To learn more, visit my [research page]({{'/my_research' | relative_url}}) and [blog posts]({{ '/blog' | relative_url}}).
