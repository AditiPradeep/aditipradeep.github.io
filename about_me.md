I am a scientist by profession. I grew up in the South Indian state of Kerala, India and completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering physics at [NIT Calicut](https://nitc.ac.in/about-us) in 2019. I moved to the beautiful city of Vancouver in 2019 to start my PhD in physics at the University of British Columbia where I work with the SuperCDMS collaboration to find and study dark matter. SuperCDMS is a collaboration of 100+ scientists from universities and National labs from around the world and is currently building an improved experiment in one of the deepest underground facilities in the world, [SNOLAB](https://www.snolab.ca/about/about-snolab/). I'm involved in several aspectes of the experiment with specific focus on data analysis, software and detector operations.

My primary research focuses on reconstructing an event or particle interaction from the acquired raw data, i.e. convert raw data into human readable information and identify signatures of dark matter. I have developed many novel reconstruction techniques which use advanced statistics and more recently, machine learning with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Principal Component Analysis. Over the past 5 years, I have successfully developed multiple reconstruction algorithms and techniques which have demonstrated the ability to improve the overall sensitivity of the experiment. To read more about this, refer to the [My Research]({{'/finding_dm_with_ML.md' | relative_url}}) page.

I played a leading role in detector testing efforts at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 2022. SLAC is surface facility where the exposure to radiation from space is large. These particles flood the detector with so many hits that the software systems cannot keep up. They also radiogenically activate certain isotopes in the detector material which can produce false signals. This is why rare event search experiments are often performed deep undergound since the rock shields against excess radiation. Currently, we are testing the same detectors at SNOLAB and I am leading the detector testing and data analysis effort for this project.

I am a developer for [MIDASDAQ](https://gitlab.com/supercdms/DAQ/MidasDAQ), the SuperCDMS data acquisition (DAQ) software and the current release manager for SuperCDMS DAQ, the umbrella package which encompasses all DAQ sub repositories. I am also a developer for [CDMSBats](https://gitlab.com/supercdms/Reconstruction/cdmsbats), the package which processes raw data and extracts meaningful physical quantities from it.

When I'm not out dark matter hunting, I enjoy swimming and watching horror movies.
