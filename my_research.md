title: Finding dark matter
---

Light from stars which are millions of light years away to the atoms which make up everything around us constitute "matter". You, me and everything around us are made up of matter. By studying processes that happen in galaxies around us or by careful studies of the residual radiation from the early universe, we can estimate the total amount of matter in the universe. It turns out that the total matter content of the universe is much larger than what we can see around us ("visible matter"). In fact, visible matter constitutes only about 5% of the total matter content of the universe. About 70% of the universe is a form of cosmological constant, called dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. The nature of dark energy is unknown to this day. The remaining matter is believed to be "dark" and played a crucial role in the early universe to give rise to the large structures we see today.

The origin and nature of dark matter is one of the biggest unresolved mysteries of the universe. Many experiments have tried to find dark matter, but it remains elusive. We know that dark matter must have some mass and exert gravitational effects on visible matter. Dark matter, if it does interact with visible matter in some non-gravitational way, must do so very weakly. The Earth's surface is bombarded by cosmic radiation which limits our ability to identify meaningful candidate signals above ground. Therefore, most dark matter experiments are performed in underground labs where the rock shields the detectors from radiation.

SuperCDMS is a direct dark matter search experiment which looks for a signal from a dark matter particle scattering off of cryogenic, superconducting detectors made of ultrapure Ge and Si crystals equipped with superconducting circuitry to readout waveforms (read more [here]({{'/blog.html' | relative_url}})). The scatter produces a recoiling nucleus or electron which produces tiny vibrations and some charges in the crystal which are measured as a digitized waveform. The signals are analyzed like typical time series data using statistics and machine learning methods. The energy transferred from the dark matter particle to the recoiling nucleus is obtained from the measured signal which can be used to trace back the mass and properties of the incoming particle.

I'm involved in many aspects of the experiment - from characterizing new detectors and noise assessment to software development and data analysis.

Advancements in technology have not only enabled us to construct extremely sensitive detectors but also use the power of data science to extract the faintest signals from large, noisy, data sets. Dark matter experiments are often slow to adapt machine learning and AI primarily because of limited training data and the limited knowledge about what a dark matter signal even looks like. My research focused on applying machine learning tools to improve the energy resolution of our detectors and thus our overall sensitivity to lighter dark matter particles. Over the course of my 5 years with SuperCDMS, I have developed novel methods, implemented code and led some important projects in the collaboration. A part of my research focussed on reconstructing an event or particle interaction from the acquired raw data, i.e. converting raw data into human readable information to help identify signatures of dark matter. I have developed many novel reconstruction techniques which use advanced statistics and, more recently, machine learning with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Principal Component Analysis. I have successfully developed multiple reconstruction algorithms and techniques which have demonstrated the ability to improve the overall sensitivity of the experiment.

I played a leading role in detector testing and pre-commissioning efforts at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 2022. SLAC is a surface facility where the exposure to cosmic radiation is large. These particles flood the detector with so many hits that the software systems cannot keep up. They also radiogenically activate certain isotopes in the detector material which can produce false signals. This is why rare event search experiments are often performed deep undergound since the rock shields against excess radiation. Currently, we are testing 6 of the new detectors at SNOLAB and I am leading the detector testing and data analysis effort for this project with the overarching goals of detector characterization, calibration and noise assessment.

I am a developer for MIDASDAQ, the SuperCDMS data acquisition (DAQ) software and the current release manager for SuperCDMS DAQ, the umbrella package which encompasses all DAQ sub repositories. I am also a developer for CDMSBats, the package which processes raw data and extracts meaningful physical quantities from it. The above repositories are privately owned by SuperCDMS and therefore if you're not a member of the SuperCDMS project on gitlab you cannot view them (even a fork). I am however happy to provide more information upon request.
